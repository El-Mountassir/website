## Execution Summary

Mission executed across two sessions on 2025-12-21:

1. **Session 1**: Created repository structure, initialized git, started calendar configuration
2. **Session 2**: Completed calendar verification, documented changes, archived mission

Key accomplishments:
- Repository fully structured with state management pattern
- Google Calendar configured with focus blocks
- Time standards documented in `docs/standards/management/time/README.md`
- Mission management system established during archival

---

## Deviations

See `deviations.md` for detailed deviation log.

Summary:
1. `system/` → `configs/system/` (architectural decision)
2. Calendar standards at different path than spec
3. Calendar hours adjusted by Omar post-execution

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Chrome integration works** - Calendar automation via MCP tools successful
2. **Verify before declaring** - Always take screenshots/evidence of external changes
3. **Expect adjustments** - User will tune outputs; document final state, not just spec
4. **Archive process needed** - This mission revealed the need for mission lifecycle standard

---

## Original Spec

Prepared by Claude Web. Full spec available in mission file history.
