## The Three Waves of AI

| Wave | Name | Characteristics |
|------|------|-----------------|
| 1st | Predictive AI | Analyze data, forecast trends, support decisions |
| 2nd | Generative AI | Create content, human-like conversations, reactive to input |
| 3rd | **Agentic AI** | Autonomous agents, goal-oriented, proactive partners |

> "We're entering the third wave, agentic AI, where AI systems gain a degree of autonomy, acting on our behalf and collaborating to achieve objectives."

## Agent Characteristics

| Characteristic | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Autonomous Action** | Achieve objectives without step-by-step human guidance |
| **Goal-Oriented** | Understand high-level goals, figure out steps autonomously |
| **Contextual Understanding** | Reason, remember context, interact with systems/data |
| **Coordination** | Networks of specialized agents (agentic fabric) |
| **Feedback Loop** | Observe → Decide → Act → Evaluate → Learn |

## Real-World Implications

### For Work
- AI becomes an **intentional collaborator**, not just a tool
- One person can run a company through agent networks
- Human roles evolve toward strategy and oversight

### For Enterprise (2025 Stats)
- 52% of enterprises using GenAI now deploy AI agents in production
- 88% of early adopters seeing tangible ROI
- 99% of enterprise developers exploring/developing AI agents

### Challenges
- Infrastructure constraints
- Trust deficit (verification, guardrails)
- Data gaps
- Ethical considerations (privacy, responsibility)

## Key Insight

> "The shift from AI as a tool to AI as a proactive partner is a real game-changer."

This is NOT about replacing humans. It's about **augmenting human capabilities** through collaboration.
