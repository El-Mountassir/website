Hi Robert, Matthew,

Here it is:

👉 https://cashdepot.vercel.app/

Took a bit longer than planned to get everything polished, but I think you'll see why when you check it on desktop and mobile.

Quick highlights:

- Mobile-first design (as promised)
- Fast loading on all devices
- "$300 to $3,000" and "No Credit Check" front and center
- All 6 banking partner logos displayed
- Clean 3-step application flow

Let me know what you think. If you want any adjustments, just say the word.

Once you're happy with it, I'll send the wire transfer details, and we'll go live.

Talk soon, Omar

Ok Merci Omar.

We can do a meeting together next week.

Hi Omar,

Was busy week. I know Xmas is next Thursday.
Are you free maybe Wednesday or perhaps the week after?
