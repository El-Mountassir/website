## Context

**Why this mission exists**:
Omar is building a consulting/services business and needs a professional way for clients to schedule meetings. The immediate need is to schedule a meeting with the Gagliano brothers (Cash Depot project), but the booking page will serve all future clients.

**Business impact**:
- Reduces friction for clients to schedule meetings
- Projects professional image
- Automates scheduling (no back-and-forth emails)
- Aligns with NORTH STAR: AI agents managing what used to require manual coordination

**Omar's client philosophy**:
- Very attentive to clients
- Wants service excellence
- Gives clients maximum time to express themselves
